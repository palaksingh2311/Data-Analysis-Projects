# Portfolio
I am Palak Singh, welcome to my Econometrics Projects repository! This collection showcases various projects I've undertaken to apply econometric theories and methodologies for academic and self-learning purposes and presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.  Each project represents a unique study, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, statistical modelling, and economic theory application.
With a strong academic background in economics and hands-on experience in data analysis, I aim to combine theoretical knowledge with practical applications in my work.

Skills Demonstrated: Statistical Analysis, Econometric Modeling, Data Visualization

Technology Used: Python

How to Navigate this Repository:
Each folder corresponds to a specific project.
Within each project folder, you will find the dataset used, the code, and a brief report summarizing the findings.

## Regression and Data Visualisation
1. [Variables Affecting Spotify Streams](https://github.com/palaksingh2311/Econometrics-Projects/blob/main/Factors%20influencing%20streams%20on%20spotify%20in%202023.ipynb): We have a dataset containing the top songs of 2023 on Spotify. The dataset provides detailed information about each song, including its characteristics, popularity, and availability on various music platforms. I did the initial data examination, data cleaning, data filtering, and descriptive analysis(visualization). Throughout these steps, the project aimed to evaluate the variables effectively and find the best-fit linear model for further analysis​.

2. [Variables Affecting Monthly Income](https://github.com/palaksingh2311/Econometrics-Projects/blob/main/Regression%20Model%20(Factors%20influencing%20monthly%20earnings%20based%20on%20individual%20and%20socio-economic%20characteristics).ipynb): I focused on building a regression model to understand the factors influencing monthly earnings based on individual and socio-economic characteristics. The model aimed to analyze how various factors like hours worked, IQ score, education level, work experience, age, marital status, race, and others affect monthly earnings​​. The Boruta Algorithm was utilized on quantitative predictors. 
The model fitting process involved extending the information system by adding copies of all variables, shuffling added attributes to remove their correlations with the response, and running a random forest classifier on the extended system. I identified features that were accepted as important, rejected as unimportant, or remained tentative.

3. [Panel Data Model](https://github.com/palaksingh2311/Econometrics-Projects/blob/main/Panel%20Data%20Model.ipynb): I provided a descriptive analysis of the variables, including histograms, fitted distributions, correlation plots, boxplots, scatterplots, and statistical summaries. Then, fit three different models - Pooled, Fixed Effects, and Random Effects. Identified the preferred model and justified the choice with effects plots, and statistical diagnostics.

4. [Qualitative Dependent Variable](https://github.com/palaksingh2311/Econometrics-Projects/blob/main/Qualitative%20Dependent%20Variable%20Model.ipynb): Discussed the data and conducted a descriptive analysis of the variables, fit three models - Linear Probability Model, Probit Model, and Logit Model. Then, chose the best model with relevant plots, and statistical diagnostics, and made different predictions.

## Machine Learning
1. [Variance VS Bias](https://github.com/palaksingh2311/Econometrics-Projects/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Variance%20VS%20Bias.ipynb): We see that as we increase the degree of the polynomial in our model, there is overfitting. The Insample MSE is decreasing because of increase in
complexity but at the same time, the Outsample MSE in both degree=2&3 is much higher than the Outsample MSE in degree=1. In the Outsample, Variance has increased significantly.

### Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Scipy.Stats and Matplotlib
